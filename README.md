# monty_hall
Simulates the Monty Hall Problem. The point was to empirically show that it is indeed better to switch doors rather than stay.

You can just run the SimulationApp.java and see for yourself! There is also a SimulationApp_parallelised.java file attached. It produces the same output as SimulationApp.java but some steps are parallelised which means it runs a bit faster. The time that is output measures only how long the parallelised part of the code takes to execute. This is only meant for comparison with the standard sequential SimulationApp.java.
